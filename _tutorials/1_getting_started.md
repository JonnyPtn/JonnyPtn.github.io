## Tools
I use these extensively, and you should have them on every platform:

- Git
- CMake

## Compilers and IDE's
Really it doesn't matter which compiler or IDE you use. If you use CMake for your projects as I recommend you do then that abstracts away the compiler anyway. For IDE's, just go with whaver environment you're comfortable with and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.

I prefer these compiler/IDE combinations which are all freely available:

- Windows: Visual Studio with it's default compiler (CL)
- macOS: Xcode with it's default compiler (Apple Clang)
- Linux: Visual Studio Code with Clang

Visual studio code is actually a pretty good option on other platforms too.
